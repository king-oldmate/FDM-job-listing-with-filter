## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (what does this really mean? Does it apply to tailwind?)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility first CSS framework

### What I learned

It's not so much that I learned something specifically, but I have this great feeling of accomplishment since it feels like working with React really clicked with me today. `useState`, `useEffect`, and props all made a lot more sense and once I had the general layout done it didn't take me long to work out how to filter jobs based upon selected tags.

On that note, I suppose the main challenge I overcame was working with different array methods to get that part completed.

### Continued development

I would like to try and add:

- [ ] a backend with REST API
- [ ] user/employer login
- [ ] job submission form
- [ ] job application form
